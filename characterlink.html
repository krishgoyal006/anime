           <i> <h1 style="color:orange">Most Loved Characters of all Time</h1></i>
    <h1>20. Kakashi Hatake (Naruto)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/8467bd4b56832ded75e54e4f18085598.Kakashi-Hatake-Naruto.jpg"><br/>
    <p>There is no doubt that Kakashi Hatake is one of the most popular characters in anime history. The sensei of team 7 has a charismatic personality and his character development in Naruto has been one to watch. He always had a mysterious personality since he used to cover his face with a mask. 
He might not have been the most powerful character in the story but he could certainly hold his weight against a formidable opponent. This was mainly because he had sharingan in one eye which led him to earn the nickname of copy ninja.</p><br/>

    <h1>19. Saitama (One Punch Man)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/376e12f0da838aead44f636a56dd48f6.Saitama-One-Punch-Man.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Saitama in One Punch Man is adored by everyone who is a fitness freak. Since an early age, Saitama has always wanted to be a hero. So one day he began his training and he trained so much that all of his hairs were lost in that process. 

        The fruits of his training were extremely good though since he became overpowered. All it took for him to defeat an enemy was a single punch. Naturally, it became boring very soon until one day get persuaded by a cyborg to join the Hero Association.</p><br/>

    <h1>18. Goku (Dragon Ball Z)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/8d58d3d1166babd925b9c41f7d10418e.Goku-Dragon-Ball-Z.jpg">
    <p>Who doesn’t know about Goku? He is the OG superhero who has been a critical part of all our childhood. Just like Saitama, Goku has also inspired many kids to take fitness seriously.


 
        However, Goku’s major attraction lies in Super Saiyan. We have all wanted to achieve Super Saiyan transformation when we were little kids and obviously it still hasn’t changed for some. Goku also has the innocence on his side that makes him sweeter than ever.</p><br/>

    <h1>17. Ken Kaneki (Tokyo Ghoul)    </h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1c2170796a561c278ca04d0300a5a331.Ken-Kaneki-Tokyo-Ghoul.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Ken Kaneki is the protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul and truly an iconic character. His transformation from a human to a ghoul is a scene that will surely go down in the history books. Ken Kaneki started as a kid who was very meek and did not even think about hurting an ant. 

        But once his first date went wrong and an illegal experiment was carried on him, it did not take long for him to turn into the white haired ghoul that struck fear in the hearts of humans and ghouls alike. Many characters will come and go but Ken Kaneki will forever remain a legend.</p><br/>

    <h1>16. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d04b69cfd4c9d40924212077bc978b0a.Itachi-Uchiha-Naruto.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Have you ever seen an anime villain getting as much love as Itachi Uchiha? Technically, Itachi Uchiha can’t be called the villain in the Naruto series. He is kind of an anti-hero who did everything for the greater good. It wouldn’t have been easy to walk in his shoes and the amount of sacrifices he made, helped him to earn a place in the heart of the fans. 
In terms of power too, Itachi was very dangerous. He was a master of Genjutsu and to kill off a single clan in just one night is no child’s walk. He is an incarnation of the word selfless and can also be called as the real hero in Naruto.</p><br/>

    <h1>15. Guts (Berserk)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/19a9bbe4bff27c5faf8eb26821e15a57.Guts-Berserk.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Guts is the main character of a series that is dark as hell. Sadly, we lost the creator of Berserk, Kentaro Miura a few months back and thus we will never get to know the ending of Guts. As a seinen protagonist, Guts has done justification to his role and fans who are new to the world of Berserk are always shocked by reading about the hardships he faced since his early life. 
        Berserk is set in a world where the law of survival is everything. The fact that Guts has survived all the hardships to join the Band of Hawks is an incredible feat in itself. After all, it’s not like he had any superpower to help him.</p><br/>

    <h1>14. Mikasa Ackerman (Attack on Titan)

    </h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/96a2286a131eeb12eef3f044a9b9fde6.Mikasa-Ackerman-Attack-on-Titan-2.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Mikasa Ackerman is not only one of the most popular characters ever but she is also one of the best waifu out there. Mikasa can be classified as a deuteragonist in Attack on Titan who fought alongside Eren Yeager. It has been clear as night and day that Mikasa always had a thing for Eren. 

        The best thing about Mikasa is that she is not your typical anime girl. She is never the damsel in distress. Quite contrary to that, she is the one rescuing other people from distress. Mikasa is by far one of the best fighters in Attack on Titan despite not having any special powers.</p><br/>

    <h1>13. Roronoa Zoro (One Piece)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/0d751f26482c55407b176f2faa1919ed.Roronoa-Zoro-One-Piece.jpg"><br/>
    <p>The first character to join Luffy’s crew will always have a special place in the hearts of fans. Zoro is not only one of the strongest characters in One Piece but also his first mate. He has a special role to play just like the first mates did for Gol D. Roger and Whitebeard. 

        What makes Zoro even more impressive is the fact that he doesn’t have any devil fruit powers. He is an excellent swordsman who can wield three swords at once and slash right through enemies.</p><br/>

    <h1>12. Sakata Gintoki (Gintama)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4beb2bae213fafd038ba591c7dfb7f67.Sakata-Gintoki-Gintama.jpg"><br/>
    <p>If Gintama is the set for a one mic stand, then Sakata Gintoki is an excellent stand up comedian. A series that is famous for its comedic elements needs a main character with a charismatic personality. Gintoki sure does provide those exact things with his hilarious gags. 

        He is sure to make you laugh so much that you will start having stomach cramps. So, if you are ever in a bad mood in the future just turn towards Gintoki and you will be fine within seconds.</p><br/>

    <h1>11. Edward Elric (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/544df2de49def778af3e58e8b86a5bd6.Edward-Elric-Fullmetal-Alchemist-Brotherhood.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Edward Elric is the Fullmetal Alchemist in this series who suffered a life of hardship along with his brother, Alphonse Elric. Ever since their little experiment to revive their mother went wrong, Edward swore to bring their bodies back with the help of the Philosopher’s Stone. 

        There is no doubt that he is a genius alchemist and scaled in power throughout the course of the story. His dynamic with his neighbor and childhood friend, Winry Rockbell was also very cute that put him in the good books of the fans.</p><br/>

    <h1>10. Light Yagami (Death Note)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2ae69652c1a7d1244f684ed6c4cc399a.Light-Yagami-Death-Note.jpg"><br/>
    <p>If an anime is hugely popular, it naturally makes the main character of that anime popular too. Light Yagami plays the role of anti-hero in Death Note. 

        He started out as a genius student whose life looked to be set in every possible way. But one day, the Death Note entered his life and it completely changed Light as a person. He became hungry for justice that turned him into a complete maniac. </p><br/>

    <h1>9. Eren Yeager (Attack on Titan)

    </h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/375c627d50a0e8039eb7d4828d33eea5.Eren-Yeager-Attack-on-Titan.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Eren Yeager perhaps fills all the roles in Attack on Titan by himself. He is the main character, hero, villain, anti-hero and everything else that you can possibly think of. He started out as a small kid who wanted to exterminate every last titans from the world. 

        The irony is that he himself turned into the thing he hates the most. But it also gave the humans a bit of a cutting edge in order to fight against those monsters. However, as Eren grew up his whole view of the world changed after learning about the history of the Titans and things turned dark real quick.</p><br/>

    <h1>8. Okabe Rintaro (Steins;Gate)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/f57b1aedc7a20e3a45517701ac81c32a.Okabe-Rintaro-SteinsGate.jpg"><br/>
    <p>A quirky scientist who stars in a top-rated series involving time travel will of course become a very popular character. Okabe Rintaro seems like a mad scientist who is always engrossed with his work. This is where his character is so well written because we see a sudden change in him midway through the series. 

        He may even come off as annoying when you start watching this anime for the first time but as you slowly pass through each episode, you will realize why many people consider Okabe as their favorite anime character.</p><br/>

    <h1>7. Naruto Uzumaki (Naruto)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/e2983d32ac47d2f60477ccae64cb6bf8.Naruto-Uzumaki-Naruto.jpg"><br/>
    <p>What else should I say about Naruto? He is the titular protagonist of this anime and the story is all about him. Naruto is a beginner’s anime series and the way he presents himself before others makes him easy to like. Natuto has everything that you would want in the main character of an anime. 

        The will to work hard, a tragic past, killer moves and sympathy for villains. He is like the perfect anime protagonist that you are bound to adore. There are numerous times in the anime when Naruto has made us fall in love with him through his actions. He even got rewarded at the end which made up for a happy ending.</p><br/>

    <h1>6. Monkey D. Luffy (One Piece)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cf5333065c96acc074e4276d41d95900.Monkey-D.-Luffy-One-Piece.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Monkey D. Luffy is not your average Shonen protagonist. He is very different from the rest and that’s what makes him so special. He is kind of air-headed which is surprisingly one of his most likable characters. 

        Luffy has scaled in power throughout the story and this has only happened because he cares a lot about his friends. He doesn’t care whether he lives or dies as long as he can protect his friends. If you first see him, he might not seem like that guy and that’s where he can surprise people. Moreover, Luffy has been known to friendzone a lot of girls in this anime.</p><br/>

    <h1>5. Killua Zoldyck (Hunter x Hunter)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ee47549406a2343f2440e4976d7ef798.Killua-Zoldyck-Hunter-x-Hunter.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Killua Zoldyck is another example of a side character who steals the show from the main character in the story. Killua was the most impressive guy out of the four-man group that existed in Hunter x Hunter. 

        It’s crazy that Gon, who plays the lead role in this anime did not manage to secure a place in this list. Killua deserves a place here owing to all his contributions in the story. The way he fought valiantly throughout the series has been one to admire. Besides being an astonishing fighter, Killua is also a great friend to Gon.</p><br/>

    <h1>4. L Lawliet (Death Note)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4e7c7f09772c159c9fe2e5db18245481.L-Lawliet-Death-Note.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Following Killua, we have yet another name on this list who stole the show from the star. L is a character whom you will not have seen in any other series. L played the role opposite to the lead character, Light Yagami and was engaged in a heated battle to catch up. 

        This battle of wits between L and Light will go down in history as one of the best fights ever. It is highly unfortunate that L ultimately lost that battle but at least he had his apprentices that decided to carry on his legacy.</p><br/>

    <h1>3. Satoru Gojo (Jujutsu Kaisen)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/0d20721bdc88b3fd06f571cf93953f35.Satoru-Gojo-Jujutsu-Kaisen.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Satoru Gojo has been linked to Kakashi as one of the most badass teachers ever. Apart from that, he is also one of the most OP characters that makes him so special. He is feared by the villains in the story so much that they decided to seal him completely as they knew they were not going to defeat him otherwise. 

        Gojo also has a quirky personality that suits him well. He doesn’t care about the higher-ups in the Jujutsu world and any authority. He lives by his own rules and has the power to match that.
        
        </p><br/>

    <h1>2. Levi Ackerman (Attack on Titan)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/322053099ff1318f3625c3d2faf3475b.Levi-Ackerman-Attack-on-Titan.jpg"><br/>
    <p>I mean there can be no doubt about Levi Ackerman being one of the most popular characters ever. People have been obsessed with him ever since his introduction. He shares the same Ackerman blood as Mikasa and can even rip apart Titans in his sleep. 

        That’s the testament to his power and his determination to make a titan free world. Levi has also got the right mentality to survive and fight against Titans. He doesn’t falter at the death of his comrades because he has gotten used to it. But that doesn’t mean he is emotionless. He just knows how to control himself well.</p><br/>

    <h1>1. Lelouch Lamperouge (Code Geass)</h1><br/>
    <img src="https://cdn-akoop.nitrocdn.com/RDBzRdxIVzPKrIYpidSafCSSkYwHdRcR/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b10433ef23b13224616d5bb1023f2e1a.Lelouch-Lamperouge-Code-Geass.jpg"><br/>
    <p>Finally, we have arrived at the most popular anime character ever and he is from Code Geass. Lelouch Lamperouge is the main character in this story and is also the center of a huge twist that takes place at the end. 

        He is not your ordinary protagonist which is evident from the fact that he has stood out among the rest. Unlike most other anime characters, he hasn’t become popular due to his brawns but rather his brain has helped him in this aspect. When it comes to wit and strategy there is no one who can even come close to Lelouch.
        
        That is it from today’s post on Top 20 Most Popular Anime Characters Of All Time.
